<h2 id="_setup">Setup</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player is dealt a suit card and place that card face up in front of them.
This card represents the suit each player is collecting.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_playing_a_round">Playing a round</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player is initially dealt six cards face down.
The remaining cards in the deck are kept face down beside the dealer.
All players look at the cards in their hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, starting with the player on the dealer&#8217;s left (clockwise), each player places one card from their hand into the middle of the table
The player who placed the highest numbered card in the middle, wins the trick and every card in the middle (the "pot").
If the pot contains a suit that the player is collecting, then that card is placed face up in the player&#8217;s collection pile.
The collection pile is located on the table just in front of the player and will be used to score points later in the game.
All other cards from the pot are swept into a waste pile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player who won the last trick must lead the next trick, and play continues.
Play continues with the highest card winning the trick, with the winner always leading.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>

<td class="content">
Suit cards cannot go directly from a player&#8217;s hand into his or her collection pile.
All suit cards must first be won from the pot.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Play any card you want.
There is no trump, and all suits are of equal rank.
You do not have to follow suit.
If you want to win the trick, play a high numbered card.
Play a low card to avoid it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_wolves">Wolves</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Wolf is the highest card in the deck and is also a means of collecting points, regardless of what suit a player is collecting.
If a player wins a pot containing a Wolf, then the Wolf is placed into the player&#8217;s collection pile and is used to score points.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_butterflies_fiasco_cards">Butterflies (Fiasco cards)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Butterfly (Fiasco) cards are considered of rank 5, so half the deck is higher, and half the deck is of lower rank.
If a player wins a trick containing a Butterfly card, then that player loses one card from his or her own collection pile for each Butterfly card in the pot.
If the player is to lose more cards than are in his or her collection pile, then the player loses only what is available.
Losses are not carried over to the next trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attempt to get rid of your Butterfly cards by inflicting them upon your opponents.
Hence, committing a Fiasco!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ties">Ties</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the winner of a trick cannot be determined because there is a tie for the highest cards played, then there is a 'tie-for-high', and more cards must be played.
The cards in the middle stay in the pot, and now have no bearing on the winner of the new trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player places another card in the middle to determine the winner of the new trick.
The winner of this trick wins all the cards in the pot.
If there is second tie-for-high, play continues until there is a winner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a tie occurs with the last cards in the player&#8217;s hands, more cards are dealt until a winner can be determined.
The only exception to this rule is, if during the Counting Round a tie-for-high occurs, the cards are ignored and are swept into the waste pile before counting points.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_re_deal">Re-deal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the initial six cards have been played, the dealer gives out another six cards from the deck to each player and play continues.
If there are insufficient cards in the deck, then each player is given an equal number of cards and these are played out.
Any remaining cards are discarded into the waste pile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When all the cards in the deck have been played, the waste pile is reshuffled and re-dealt.
The person dealing changes with each new deck, rotating clockwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The deck is exhausted three times before players count their points.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_points">Points</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the deck has been exhausted three times, play stops and players count the cards in their collection piles.
This is called the Counting Round.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2 points for each suit card they have collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 point for each Wolf in their collection pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 bonus points for having all six Wolves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 bonus points for having all seven of their suit cards</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After counting points, all the cards are collected and re-shuffled.
Players collect the same suit as before.
Points from each Counting Round are added together to determine the player&#8217;s overall score.</p>
