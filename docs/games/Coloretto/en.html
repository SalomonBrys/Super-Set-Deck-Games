<p>The 2 -5 players draw cards from a card supply in the middle of the table.
During the game, the players try to specialize in a few colors, because at the end of the game, a player can score plus points for only 3 colors; the rest score minus points.
The more cards a player has of a color, the more points he scores.
The player with the most points wins.</p>
