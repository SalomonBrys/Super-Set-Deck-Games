<p>A long time ago in the land of the rising sun, spirits and demons known as Yokai were harming human lives.
Yokai did not directly attack people, but they were causing supernatural disasters: Yokai caused farmlands to burn, rivers to flood, thunders to roar, and diseases to spread.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One day a chieftain of the nearby village visited you, an Onmyoji, a practitioner of Japanese esoteric cosmology.
Through your knowledge of astronomy and occultism, you discovered the only way to help save the village.
It is simple: the more Yokai you manage to capture, the less the menace caused by these demons.
After a few months in the village, you are successful in your efforts; the Yokai menace is completely eradicated in that village!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, word reaches you of the havoc being wrecked by the Yokai on your own village.
In your absence, the village chieftain has consulted another Onmyoji to help save your village.
This is an affront because this is your village and the people under attack are your people.
It is your job to save the day!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not let another Onmyoji save the day and go down in history as the greatest there ever was and the Savior of your village at the time of need.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Yokai Septet, your goal is to capture high scoring Boss Yokai (<strong>K</strong> cards) by strategically playing cards from your hand.
Each turn, players play a card from their hand following the rules of the "trick-taking games."
(If you don&#8217;t know what this means, don&#8217;t worry. This is explained in more details later.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After everyone has played a card, the player who played the strongest card takes all the cards played this turn.
A new turn continues until one of the round&#8217;s end condition is met.
At the end of the round, the winner of that round is determined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a 4-player game, the game is played as a team battle of two players versus two players, whereas in a 3-player game, all players play individually competing.
The winner of the round is the team that captured four or more Boss Yokai in a 4-player game, and three or more Boss Yokai in a 3-player game.
However, be careful on winning too many turns because you will lose the round if you win 7 turns before collecting the specified number of Boss Yokai!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The winner of the round scores points based on the Boss Yokai they captured.
New rounds are played until the game&#8217;s end condition is met, which can be either 2 points for a basic game, or 7 points for a traditional or an advanced game.</p>

<h2 id="_variant_4_player_game_seven_suitors">Variant 4-player game: Seven Suitors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a variant 4-player game rule using the two sets of K cards.
We recommend playing this variant only after everyone has played and understood the rules of the base game.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_game_overview_2">Game Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this game is to be the first team to capture and seal Boss Yokai of all seven suits.
To seal a suit, your team must capture both Boss Yokai <strong>K</strong> cards of a given suit during a round (not necessarily in a single trick).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_before_the_game_2">Before the Game</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like the base game, split up into two teams of two players each.
Team members should sit across from each other, so each player’s opponents are to their left and right.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One team takes the set of 7 J cards and the other team takes the set of 7 Q cards.
These cards are the "capture" cards: they are put face up to the side of the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Use two set of K’s</strong>.
You will play with a deck of 56 cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 0 cards are only used to indicate the trump suit and are not shuffled with the game cards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_round_setup">Round Setup</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Place the 7 0 cards in a face-down pile in the middle of the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shuffle the deck of 56 cards.
Deal a hand of 14 cards face-down to each player.
There will be no cards remaining.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player looks at their hand and passes one card to each other player face-down.
That is, each player will be passing 3 cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player who was dealt the A card reveals it, and becomes the first Lead Player.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_game_play_rules_2">Game Play Rules</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Lead Player will play first.
They choose any card from their hand and play it face-up in front of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The suit of the first card played by the Lead Player each round determines the Trump Suit for the rest of the round.</strong>
Find the corresponding 0 card in the pile of 0 cards and place it face-up on top of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every other player plays a card exactly the same way as the base game.
That is, they must play a card of the same suit as the Lead Player, and may only play a card off suit if a player has no cards of that suit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_taking_a_trick">Taking a trick</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trick is taken in exactly the same way as the base game except when both Ks of a suit are played and would win the trick.
In this case, the first K played wins and takes the trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you take the trick, take all the cards played this trick.
If you took any Boss Yokai <strong>K</strong> cards, keep them face-up in front of you.
If your team has now taken both Ks of a given suit this round, then seal that suit for your team by returning face-down your team&#8217;s capture card of that suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, the player who took the trick becomes the next trick&#8217;s Lead Player.
Continue playing the next trick until all 14 cards are played.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_end_of_a_round">End of a Round</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The round is over after playing all cards in your hand, which is 14 tricks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Play another round until one team has sealed all seven suits.
This will generally take multiple rounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_end_of_a_game">End of a Game</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game is over as soon as one team seals all seven suits, even in the middle of a round.
That team claims victory!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_shorter_variant">Shorter Variant</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of having each team seal all seven suits, in this variant each suit is sealed by the first team to capture both Ks of a suit in a round.
The first team to seal four of the seven suits wins the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not use the set of J cards.
Place the 7 Q cards face up to the side of the table.
When a team seals a suit, they take the corresponding Q card for themselves.</p>
