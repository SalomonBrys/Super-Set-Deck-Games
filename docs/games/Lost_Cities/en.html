<div class="paragraph">
<p>Place your cards to form expedition routes that lead you to remote and mysterious corners of the Earth:
the Himalayan mountains, the Central American rainforest, the Egyptian desert, a mysterious volcano, and the bottom of the sea.
And if you are particularly daring, you can also bet on the success of an expedition with wager cards.
But beware: this can backfire.
If after three games you have the highest overall score, you win.</p>

The game rules are very simple.
But don&#8217;t get the wrong  impression.
There is much more to discover in Lost Cities than it might seem at first glance!

<p>Each player’s goal is to form expedition routes that — after subtracting the expedition costs — earn the player as many discovery points as possible.
You set up the expeditions by forming  a separate column of cards for each color.
The numeric values within a column of cards must increase from card to card.
You can place wager cards at the beginning of each column to multiply a column’s value.
At the end of the game, the cards in each player’s columns are scored.</p>
