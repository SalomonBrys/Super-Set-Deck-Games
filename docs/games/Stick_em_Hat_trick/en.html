<p>The starting player begins by leading a card from his hand into the centre of the table.
This begins a trick.
In order the other players add a card either in the first-played colour, or in a second colour.
With the second colour a second trick is begun.
Thus, a double trick develops.</p>

<p>The player who played the card with the highest value wins the trick.
With a double trick each colour is won as a separate trick.
The trick winners take their tricks and place their cards in face up piles separated by colour.
Thus, everyone sees who has collected which colour.</p>

<p>A player now has up to three face-up piles in front of him, and possibly face-down cards, if he passed during play.
Each player counts his cards in the respective colours.
The colour in which he counts the most cards scores as one positive point per card.
If there is a tie between two or three of the colours, the player chooses one colour to count as positive points.
All cards from the other colours count as one negative point per card.
Face down cards, from passing during play, count as two negative points each, regardless of the colour of the card.</p>
