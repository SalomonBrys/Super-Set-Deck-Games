Reveal 2 cards from your hand to another player.
They must respond by saying <strong>“yes”</strong> or <strong>“no”</strong>, revealing whether or not they have a card equal to the sum of those cards.

<p>With two players, it is possible that the first player may be able to deduce the Drop at the end of his first turn.
To prevent this, you can apply the following variant that slows the 2-players game a bit:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each of the two players receive one less card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 cards are placed face down next to the Drop, this is <strong>The Middleman</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can <strong>Share Info</strong> with the Middleman by trading <strong>1</strong> face down card from their hand with one of these two cards.</p>
