<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deal">Deal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choose a dealer, who shuffles and deals all 56 cards face-down to the players evenly.
Players keep their hands hidden throughout the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player is partnered with the player sitting opposite him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players take turns being the dealer in subsequent rounds, rotating clockwise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_establish_a_captain">Establish a captain</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After looking at his cards, the dealer decides if he wants to be the Captain.
If the dealer declines, the option to become Captain passes clockwise.
The first person to accept becomes the Captain, but if all 4 players pass, the dealer must assume the Captain’s role.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_choose_point_suit_strategy">Choose point suit &amp; strategy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Captain chooses and announces the point suit for the round.
He places the corresponding A card in the center of the table as a reminder during the round.
(At the end of the round, each card of the point suit is equal to one point card, regardless of the number value on the card.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, he decides whether he wants to tell his partner that their strategy is to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>win point cards totaling <strong>less than or equal to 4</strong> (by giving him the Butterfly card), or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>win point cards totaling <strong>more than or equal to 10</strong> (by giving him the Wolf card).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Captain gives his partner the chosen Strategy card face-down, which the partner checks and then place face-down near the A card at the center of the table.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pass_cards">Pass cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Captain passes 3 cards face-down to his partner.
The partner <strong>can</strong> look at the passed cards, and then he passes 3 <strong>different</strong> cards from his hand face-down back to the Captain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player to the Captain’s left simultaneously does the same with his partner, however they only exchange <strong>2</strong> cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passed cards then become part of the players’ hands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_play">Play</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player with the ♠1 card starts the first trick by leading that card face-up (or the ♥1 card, if ♠ is the point suit), and play proceeds clockwise.
Each of the other players plays one card face-up, following suit.
If a player does not have a card in his hand of the suit led, he can discard any card (and if he discards a card of the point suit, the point suit is considered “broken”).
There are <strong>no</strong> trump cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After each player has played, the player who played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and leads to the next trick.
The winner of the trick takes the cards and places them face-down before him in <strong>two</strong> piles, separating point cards from non-point cards (taken cards cannot be viewed thereafter, but any player can count them).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player cannot lead a card of the point suit until the point suit is broken (unless he only has cards of the point suit in his hand, and thus has no choice).
The point suit cannot be broken on the first trick (again, unless a player has no choice).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The round ends after all cards have been played (or when the round’s scoring outcome is no longer in question).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_expose_strategy">Expose strategy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When</p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>at least half of the tricks have been played, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>either</strong> partnership has taken at least 5 point cards <strong>by itself</strong>,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>whichever comes first, the Captain’s opponents are permitted to turn over and expose the Strategy card.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(e.g.: In a 4-player game, the Captain &amp; his partner together have already taken 4 total point cards, and their opponents also have already taken 4 total point cards.
The opponents can turn over the Strategy card once either partnership takes at least one more point card, or after 7 tricks have been played, whichever comes first.)</p>

<p>The Captain’s opponents generally should “break” the point suit as early as possible.
This enables them to observe whether the Captain &amp; his partner are trying to take or avoid point cards.</p>

<p>If the Captain chooses the Wolf, his partner generally should pass his highest cards (frequently of the point suit) to the Captain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Captain chooses the Butterfly, and his partner’s only cards of the point suit all have high number values, such as 12, 13 &amp; 14, the partner should consider passing some of these cards to the Captain.</p>

<li>
<p>The last card is not dealt. It is set aside, face-down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The partnerships change each round.
The Captain’s partner is the player sitting 3 seats to his left, with whom the Captain exchanges 2 cards, in the same manner described above.
The other 3 players play as a team against the Captain and his partner.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player to the Captain’s left passes 2 cards face-down to the player seated to the Captain’s right, who then passes 2 different cards face-down in return.
The remaining player, sitting 2 seats to the Captain’s left, adds the non-dealt card to his hand, and then he discards any one card (even the card just added to his hand).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all cards have been passed, the discarded card is then turned face-up, set aside, and is not played.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the ♠1 card is the discarded face-up extra card, the ♠2 card leads the first trick (or if ♠ is the point suit and the ♥1 card is the extra card, the ♥2 card leads the first trick).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the round, after all tricks have been played, the Captain can elect whether or not he wants to include the extra card (if it is a point card) in his team’s point card total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scores are recorded as above, but each player (instead of the team) receives the points (e.g. the Captain’s opponents each receive 2 points for winning the round).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every 5 rounds (after each player has had a turn being the dealer), randomly change the seat order of all players by redrawing for seats.
New partnership combinations will almost assuredly result.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player with the lowest score becomes the next dealer (if 2 or more players are tied for last place, then the youngest of these players becomes the dealer).
The deal rotates clockwise thereafter.</p>
