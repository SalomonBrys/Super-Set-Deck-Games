<p>Choose a start player.
This person shuffles the deck, then places it face-down.
Each player takes 12 money.</p>

<h2 id="_playing_the_game">Playing the Game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game is played over several rounds, with each round divided into two phases:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Turn over cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auction these cards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game ends after 15 rounds, after which all the cards will have been auctioned.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_1_turn_over_cards">1. Turn over cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In each round, a different number of cards are revealed: in the first round, one card; in the second round, two cards; in the third round, three cards; then repeat this pattern.
Thus: 1 - 2 - 3 - 1 - 2 - 3 - etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_2_auction_these_cards">2. Auction these cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the revealed cards are sold as a lot.
The start player makes the first bid at any amount of his choosing.
The next player in clockwise order must make a higher bid or drop out of this auction.
Then the next player in clockwise order either raises or drops out, etc.
When all players but one have dropped out, the high bidder places the cards face-up in front of himself, then pays money equal to the bid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no player bids on the lot, then the start player takes these cards for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock caution">

<td class="content">
Players may not bid more than they can pay.
If this occurs, the offending player must discard one of his previously won cards as a penalty.
This card is removed from the game.
The revealed cards are auctioned once again, and the offending player may not participate.

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_who_gets_the_money">Who gets the money?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the price for a lot is set, you must determine who gets the money.
Two factors play a role here: the winning bid, and the numbers on the cards that players have previously won.
If the bid matches the number on an owned card, the owner of that card receives a share of the money.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. Single player distribution</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke buys a lot for 7 money.
Bert owns the only card with a number 7, so Bert takes the 7 money from Anke.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players who own the same number of cards with a matching number receive an equal share of the winning bid.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 2. Multiple players distribution</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dieter buys two cards for 9 money.
Anke, Bert and Claus each own one card with the number 9.
Dieter pays Anke, Bert and Claus 3 money each.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player who owns more cards with a matching number than anyone else receives all the winning bid by himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 3. Majority player distribution</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke buys a card for 8 money.
Bert owns two cards and Claus one with the number 8.
The 8 money go to Bert because he owns more cards with the number 8 than Claus.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If no one owns a card with a matching number, the money is distributed evenly.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 4. Even distribution</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke buys a card for 6 money.
No one owns a card with the number 6, so the money is split evenly among all players other than Anke.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_two_digit_numbers">Two-digit numbers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the winning bid is a two-digit number, the units digit determines how the money is distributed.
Thus, on a bid of 14, the number to match is 4; on a 10, the 0, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 5. Two-digit distribution</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Claus buys three cards for 12 money.
Burt owns the only card with a 2.
Because only the last number counts with double-digit bids, Burt receives the 12 money.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_remainders">Remainders</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bid won&#8217;t always be evenly divisible.
When this happens, round down to distribute the money evenly.
Place any remaining money in the middle of the table (in the Pot) and distribute them with the payment of the next auction.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 6. Distribution with remainder</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke must pay Bert and Claus 13 money.
They receive 6 money each, and the remaining money is placed in the Pot.
In the next round, Bert must pay 9 money to Anke and Claus.
When the money that lies in the Pot is added in, each of them will receive 5 money.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bid_restrictions">Bid restrictions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important restriction applies to bids: A player may not make a bid that matches the numbers on the cards that he has already acquired.
This includes any two-digit bid in which the final digit matches these numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone who makes such a bid must pay a penalty money to the Pot (provided he has money), even if he corrects himself immediately.
The incorrect bid is withdrawn, and the player must make a new bid or pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 7. Possible bids</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke owns cards with the numbers 4 and 6.
He may therefore not make bids of 4, 6, 14, 16, etc.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_next_round">Next round</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whoever wins the auction becomes the new start player.
The two phases are repeated: Turning over cards and auctioning them.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_side_auctions">Side auctions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a player runs into financial difficulty, he may — if he wishes — sell one of his cards in a side auction.
He does this at the start of a round before new cards are turned face-up.
Since the player is selling one of his own cards, he receives all the money.</p>

<h2 id="_end_of_the_game">End of the Game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all cards have been auctioned, scoring occurs.
The more cards you have of the same color, the more points you receive:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 card = 1 point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 cards of the same color = 3 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 cards of the same color = 6 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 cards of the same color = 10 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 cards of the same color = 15 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever holds the most money receives 2 points.
If several players hold the same highest number of money, they each receive 2 points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player with the most points wins.
In case of a tie, the player with the highest sum of numbers on their cards wins.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_invasions">Invasions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start of each round, an additional "Exchange" phase takes place.
(At the beginning of the game, no one owns any cards, so this phase is skipped.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The start player goes first and announces whether or not he will exchange a card.
If he does, he simply takes a card from an opponent and places it in front of himself, then gives the opponent one of his own cards.
The opponent can do nothing to prevent this.
Then the next player in clockwise order has the opportunity to exchange, and so forth.
After everyone has had the opportunity to exchange&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;at most once per round&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;new cards are turned over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players who chose to exchange a card may not participate in the auction this round!
If all players exchange cards, the auction doesn&#8217;t occur and the start player takes the revealed cards for free.</p>

<h3 id="_serengeti">Serengeti</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Players start with 10 money (instead of 12), and 3 money per player in the bank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever a player passes without having previously bid on a set, he gets 2 coins from the bank (limited by the bank supply).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bid is distributed proportionally: it is divided by the quantity of cards with the bid number, each card owner gets that much for each card he owns</p>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anke buys a card for 8 money.
Bert owns two cards and Claus one with the number 8.
Bert received 4 money and Claus 2.
The remaining two money goes to the pot.</p>
</div>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whoever has most coins at the end of the game, gets 3 points.</p>
