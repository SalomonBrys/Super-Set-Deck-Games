<p>Each time a trick is won a player&#8217;s character moves one free space forwards.
If a player reaches a ⎈ space, then they can choose which suit is trumps.</p>

<p>The decision as when to change trumps and when to play the Super-Trump Card must be carefully made since they are decisive to the game.
