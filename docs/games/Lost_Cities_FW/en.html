<p>Hunt for points in the jungle!
One player flip four cards, chooses two as a result and writes it on their game sheet.
All other players also choose a result from the remaining cards and write it on their sheets.
Numbers must be noted in ascending order.
Those who land on the acceleration boxes or find gems may count themselves lucky.
If you cannot or do not want to write anything down, you can use your passes.
But not too often, as you want to make as much progress as possible in order to end with the most points.</p>

<p><strong>Expeditions:</strong><br>
The game sheet shows six coloured expeditions running from the bottom to the top.
Each of the six expeditions has a different colour, corresponding to the six colours of the cards.
The expedition on the left is ♠, the one next to it ♥, then ♣, ♦, ✿ and ★.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gems and passes:</strong><br>
The right side of the game sheet shows a column with gems and next to it a column with card passing symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Score hexes:</strong><br>
At various places in the sheet, the small hexagons show the respective points for scoring:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>on the left for the six expeditions (from -50 to 50)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the right for the gems and card passing symbols (from -40 to 100 and 0)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a row with the bonus points (20 each) in the upper third of the sheet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empty score hexes:</strong><br>
At the end of the game, write your points in the empty hexagons at the top of the game sheet.
Points are scored for the six expeditions, the gems column and the card passing column.
In the large empty hexagon at the top right, write your name and your overall score.</p>

<p><strong>Double point circle:</strong><br>
If you circle the ×2 value at the bottom of an expedition, the points of this expedition are doubled.</p>

<h4 id="_acceleration_box">Acceleration box</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you write a number in a box with an arrow, you can accelerate any one of your expeditions.
To accelerate, enter the same number in the next box up on your chosen expedition.
(For example, if the expedition you chose to accelerate has a 2 as the highest number, enter a 2 in the box above that one.)
If the box you choose is also an acceleration box, you can accelerate again.

<p><strong>Recommendation — play in sequence:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most cases, players will make their choice independently and may act simultaneously.
Sometimes, however, your own choice will depend on the choices made by others (for example, when receiving bonus points).
In this case you may request that the card combinations be chosen and written into the game sheet in clockwise direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if acting simultaneously, it is best to announce your entry out loud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you come across acceleration boxes, gem or bridges, you should also announce how you will proceed.
Then the next player in clockwise direction announces their choice, writes it into their game sheet, and so on.
This is the most exciting way to play, as everyone has an understanding of their opponents‘ turns</p>
