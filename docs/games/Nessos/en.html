<p>During the whole game, the players must bluff in order to win the numbered cards.
When your turn comes, offer a numbered card to another player.
He can accept it, or refuse it by offering it to another player.
Collect numbered cards in order to be the first to reach the number of points required.
But be careful, if you get 3 Animal cards, you loose the round.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name of the game, Nessos, comes from an amphora representing a combat between Heracles and the Centaur Nessos.
This amphora dates from end of 7th century B.C. and is so famous that the artist who created it, still unknown to this day, is called the painter of Nessos.</p>
