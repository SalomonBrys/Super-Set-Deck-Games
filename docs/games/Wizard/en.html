<h2 id="_the_deal">The Deal</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To determine a dealer, each player is dealt one card.
High card deals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the first deal each player receives one card.
Two cards are dealt on the second deal, three on the third and so on.
The deal passes to the left after each round and the new dealer shuffles all 60 cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the deal, the next card is turned up to determine the trump suit.
If the card turned up is a Butterfly, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round.
If the card turned up is a Wolf, the dealer chooses one of the four suits as the trump suit.
On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_bidding">Bidding</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player in turn beginning to the left of the dealer states the number of tricks he/she will take (zero
or one on the first round) and the scorer records it on the score-pad. The total number of tricks bid may
or may not equal the total number of tricks available.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_play">The Play</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The play begins to the left of the dealer.
Any card may be led.
Players continue to play in clockwise order and must follow suit if possible.
If a player cannot follow the suit led, the player may play any other suit, including the trump suit.
A Wolf or a Butterfly may be played at any time, even if the player is holding a card of the suit led.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A trick is won:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>by the first Wolf played.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if no Wizard is played, by the highest trump played.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if no trump is played, by the highest card of the suit led.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The winner of the trick leads next.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_leading_wolf_or_butterfly">Leading Wolf or Butterfly</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the lead card is a Wolf, it wins the trick and players may play any card they wish, including another Wolf.
If the lead card is a Butterfly, it is a null card and the suit for this round is determined by the next card played.
Butterflies always lose.
The one exception to this is if only Butterflies are played, the first Butterfly played wins the trick.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_scoring">Scoring</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For correctly predicting the number of tricks taken, a player scores 2 points and receives 1 additional point for each trick taken.
A player whose prediction is incorrect loses 1 points for each over or under trick.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_length_of_game">Length of Game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are 60 cards in the deck.
Play continues until the round in which all the cards are dealt out.
Consequently, three players play 20 rounds, four players play 15 rounds, five players 12 rounds, and six players 10 rounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keeping_track_of_tricks">Keeping Track of Tricks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before play begins, the scorer should announce how many tricks have been called for by each player.
Each player should also keep tricks won in plain view for others to see.
Some players find it helpful to use coins or poker chips to indicate the number of tricks called for.
This enables all players to readily see how many tricks each player needs.</p>

<h2 id="_bidding_variations">Bidding variations</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Hidden Bid</strong>: All players simultaneously reveal their bid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delayed Reveal Bid</strong>: All players record their bid.
After the hand has been played the bids are revealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optional Rule</strong>: If the last player to bid has the highest score recorded on the score-pad, he/she cannot bid to make the bids "even".
An "even" bid is when the total tricks bid equals the total tricks available.
This means that someone must lose points after the play of a hand because more or fewer tricks have been bid than are available.
This rule does not apply if there is a tie for the lead.</p>
