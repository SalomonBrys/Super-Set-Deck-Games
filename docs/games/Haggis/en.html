<p>A game of Haggis is played over several rounds (hands).
For the first round, select one of the players to be dealer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Place one Butterfly, one Snake, and one Wolf face-up in front of each player: these are wild cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shuffle the remaining cards and deal 14 face-down to each player.
A player’s hand consists of these 14 dealt cards which are picked up and held in hand plus the 3 wild cards which remain face-up on the table until played.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The remaining cards (8 cards for 2 players, 3 cards for 3 players), the Haggis, are put aside without looking at them.</p>

<h3 id="_betting">Betting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players may bet to be the first to “go out” (shed all cards from hand).
A bet may be declared at any time before the player has played any cards.
The player declares a bet for 0 points (No Bet), 15 points (Little Bet), or 30 points (Big Bet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All players may place bets. The bets do not have to be equal.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each round is played over of a number of tricks.
For the first round, the player to the dealer’s left leads to the first trick by playing an opening card combination.
A card combination may be a set, a sequence, or a bomb.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sets">Sets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A set is a group of cards of the same rank.
Sets may consist of one to eight cards (singles, pairs, 3 of a kind, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. Sets</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>♣8 = Single.<br>
♠8 + ♦8 = Pair.<br>
♥8 + ♦8 + ♣8 = 3 of a kind.<br>
♥8 + ♦8 + ♣8 + ♠8 + ✿8 + B = 6 of a kind with a wild card.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sequences">Sequences</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A sequence (or run) is a set of three or more singles, or two or more larger sets (pairs, 3 of a kind, etc.) of consecutive rank.
Each card in the run must be of a same suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 2. Sequences</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>♥7 + ♥8 + ♥9 = Run of three singles (7-8-9).<br>
♥10 + B + S = Run of 3 Singles (10-B-S).<br>
6♣, 7♣, S, ♣9, 10♣, B = Run of 6 Singles (6-7-8-9-10-B, with wild card).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>♥8 + ♦8 + ♥9 + ♦9 = Run of 2 Pairs.<br>
♥7 + ✿7 + ♥8 + ✿8 + ♥9 + ✿9 = Run of 3 Pairs.<br>

<h3 id="_wild_card">Wild Card</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Butterfly, Snake, or Wolf may also be used as wild cards to stand for any lower ranked card(s) in a set or sequence (example: a Butterfly can stand for an 8, but cannot be substituted for a Wolf).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When played as part of a sequence, wild cards may have whichever suit is required.</p>

The B, S, W cards do not have to be played as wild cards, they can be played as singles, in a set or sequence.<br>
Example: a B will beat a single 10; 9-10-B will beat 8-9-10; 10-10-B-S (where the B is “natural” and the S “wild”) can be played as a sequence to beat 9-9-10-10.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When played as part of a larger combination (set or sequence), the combination must contain at least one non-wild card (otherwise the combination would be a bomb).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bombs">Bombs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A bomb is a special combination of point cards that will be further explained in <a href="#trick">Trick Play</a>.
There are 6 types of bombs.
Ranked from lowest to highest:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>3-5-7-9 (these 4 ranks in 4 different suits, no wild cards)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B-S</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B-W</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S-W</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B-S-W</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-5-7-9 (these 4 ranks in one suit, no wild cards).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="trick">Trick Play</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a combination of cards is led, play proceeds clockwise with each other player having the option to play a higher ranking combination or pass.
Note that a player with a higher combination can choose to pass instead of playing it.
A player without a higher combination must pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be higher ranking, the new combination must be of the exact same type, have the exact same number of cards, and have higher ranking cards.
So if a single card is led, only a higher single card can be played; if a pair is led only a higher pair can be played; a three card sequence can only be beaten by a higher three card sequence; and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bombs are the only exception to this rule.
A bomb can be played, in turn order, to beat any combination except a higher bomb.
After a bomb has been played only a higher ranked bomb may beat it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players continue to play in this manner, playing successively higher combinations of the same size and type (or bombs) or passing until a combination is played and all the other players pass in succession.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a two player game, the trick ends as soon as one player passes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a three player game the trick ends as soon as two players pass in succession.
A player that passes may still play until the trick ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the trick ends, the player who played the highest combination is the winner of the trick.
If the highest combination played was a not a bomb, the cards played to the trick are captured by the winner.
If the trick was won by a bomb, the cards played to the trick are captured by one of the winner’s opponents (the winner of the trick chooses which).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The winner of the trick leads the next trick.
In a three player game, if the winner of the trick has gone out, the player to her left leads.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ending_the_round">Ending the Round</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When all but one player has shed the cards from her hand, the round is over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last player to play a combination captures all cards played to the final trick (unless the last combination played was a bomb in which case the cards in the final trick are captured by an opponent, as detailed in <a href="#trick">Trick Play</a>).
The final player does not get to play any more cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All cards remaining in the final player’s hand and the Haggis are captured by the player who went out first.
Remember to record the number of cards (including wild cards) in the remaining player’s hand.</p>
