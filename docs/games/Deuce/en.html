<p>Deuce is a card-matching game that really tests your timing and strategic ability.
Play a card from your hand to match the color or number on one of your discard piles — or on any opponent&#8217;s discard pile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is to go "out" (play the last card from your hand) with the highest total showing on your discard piles.
To do that, you must play your cards to raise the total on your discard piles, and to lower the totals of your opponents'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scores are totaled at the end of each round (points are awarded to the winner), and the first player to reach 100 points wins the game!</p>

<p>Choose a player to deal first.
The deal passes to the left at the start of each round to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dealer shuffles the cards and deals 6 cards, face-down, to each player.
The remaining cards are placed face-down in the middle of the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The first move:</strong> To begin the game, look at the cards in your hand.
Then place two cards of your choice face-up, side-by-side, directly in front of you.
Each player does the same.
These two cards begin your discard piles, on which you — and your opponents — may play throughout the game.</p>

<p>Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise, each player in turn plays a card from his or her hand.
Cards can be played on either of your own discard piles (the two cards in front of you), or on any of your opponents' piles.
The object is to go "out" of a round with the highest total on your own discard piles.
For example, two 10&#8217;s, for a total of 20, is the highest score you can have.</p>

<p>In addition to the numbered cards, the deck contains six Butterfly Cards and two Wolf Cards.
These cards should be reserved for extra-strategic plays, when they can do you the most good and your opponent the most damage.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_butterfly">Butterfly</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Butterfly Card matches — and can be matched by — any card at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can play a Butterfly Card on one of your own discard piles, or on any opponent&#8217;s discard pile, to match any card.
By the same rule, any card can be played next to a Butterfly Card.
For example, if a Butterfly Card is played on one of your discard piles, a ♣2 can be played next to it, then a ♥6, and so on — the initial color match isn&#8217;t permanent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Butterfly Card has a scoring value of zero — which can bring down an opponent&#8217;s score at just the right moment!
It is good strategy to play one of these cards on the discard pile of an opponent with a high total who might be ready to play his or her last card to win the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can play any card on top of a Butterfly Card, as long as it matches the color or number of the card next to it at the time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_wolf">Wolf</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like Butterfly Cards, Wolf Cards have scoring values of zero, and can be played on any card at any time.
Wolf Cards, however, are more hazardous than Butterfly Cards.
If a Wolf Card is played on one of your own discard piles, only a Butterfly Card will match it.
Until a Butterfly Card is played next to the Wolf Card, no play can be made on either pile.
Once the Butterfly Card is played, number cards can be played according to the Butterfly Card rules, above.</p>

Another Wolf Card can be played next to a Wolf Card.
In such a case, you can match either Wolf Card with a Butterfly Card, then begin playing number cards according to Butterfly Card rules.

You can go "out" only if the final score on your discard piles ties with, or is higher than any of the other players' final scores.
In case of a tie, the player who goes "out" wins the round.
