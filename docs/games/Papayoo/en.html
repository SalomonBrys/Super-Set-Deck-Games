<p>Each Payoo (★) card has its own rank ranging from 1 to 20 (points).
One of the four 7’s from one of the four suits (♠, ♥, ♣ or ♦) is the Papayoo which changes with each new round.
The Papayoo (★) card is worth 40 points.

<h3 id="_discarding">Discarding</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After sorting their cards, players can start discarding.
Each player discards the cards of his choice.
Each player removes the number of cards as indicated on the table above and places them, face down, in front of the player to his left.
Each player must give his discarded pile to the player on the left before looking at the discarded pile of cards coming from the player on the right.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_papayoo_draw">The Papayoo draw</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the discarding process is finished, the dealer shuffles the Papayoo determiner cards (<strong>K</strong> cards), draws one randomly, and places it face up on top of its pile to determine the Papayoo suit.
For example, if the <strong>♠K</strong> comes up, then the <strong>7</strong> of ♠ is the Papayoo for this round and is worth 40 points.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_playing_a_round">Playing a round</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dealer starts the first trick by placing the card of his choice, face up, in the middle of the table.
The other players then take turns playing clockwise always sticking to the initial suit.
Players do not have to play a card of higher rank.
The Payoo (★) is a fifth suit the same as ♠, ♥, ♣ &amp; ♦.
If a player does not have the suit requested in his hand, he discards a card of his choice.
The player who played the highest ranking card in the suit collects the cards and starts the next trick.
If no players have cards from the requested suit, the player who started collects the cards.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_end_of_round">End of round</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the last game, the players count their points.
Each Payoo is worth its own rank.
The Papayoo is worth 40 points and the other cards have no value.
The total score for a round should equal 250.
Players add these points to their previous score.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_game_over">Game over</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the start of the game, players decide the number of hands they wish to play.
Four hands last approximately 30 minutes.
The player with the least points at the end of the last hand is the winner.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_remarks">Remarks</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When discarding, players should not forget that discarding a complete suit to have the best discarding possibilities could also mean being left with one “lone” 7 and/ or one 9 and/or one 10 from another player’s discarded pile!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To avoid winning a trick, players are often tempted to play lower ranking cards than those played by previous players.
Players should know to “build up a few points” in the first rounds when the stakes are low to then get rid of their highest ranking cards and keep the lower ranking cards for the following rounds.
This can even be an advantage for the last player as they clearly knows the ranking of the cards.</p>
