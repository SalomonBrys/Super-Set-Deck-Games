Those 3 cards represent the <strong>trump board</strong>.

<p>To start a turn (a trick), the first player must play a card.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following players can then choose:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Participate in the trick:</strong> The player must put a card of the same suit as that played by the first player.
If they have none, they must play a card of the trump suit.
If they have none, they can play a card of their choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pledge:</strong> The player who wishes to pledge <strong>does not put their card in the trick</strong> but instead <strong>plays it horizontally in from of themselves</strong>.
A card of any suit can be played this way because the pledge card is not part of the trick.
The player thus taks a number of animal cards according to the value of the pledge card and places these face up in front of themselves:</p>

<p>In the course of the round, as tricks and Animals are gotten, a player can shelter their animals.
To do so, the player places an Animal card face up on top of a trick, both of which they own, thus providing shelter to the animal.
