<h2 id="_general_idea_of_the_game">General idea of the game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cards with the high values are the strongest, but somewhat awkwardly.<br>
The cards with the low values are the weakest, but can be played smartly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player plays a card in turn.<br>
The player with the lowest card receives the highest card as profit.<br>
The player, who had the highest card, receives all remaining cards as profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the round, players get points in each color.<br>
If one has, in a certain color, only one or two cards, one gets the face value in each case – which can be very lucrative.<br>
If one has more than two cards in a certain color, each of these cards only counts 1 point.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to the number of players, some cards must first be sorted out.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>With 3 players only cards with the values 1-9 are required (= 45 cards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With 4 players only cards with the values 1-12 are required (= 60 cards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With 5 players only cards with the values 1-15 are required (= 75 cards).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With 6 players all cards are required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cards that are not required are put aside.
The cards are shuffled and evenly distributed.
Each player receives 15 cards, that they take into their hand.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player who sits at the dealers left begins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They choose any of their cards and play it, i.e.: they disclose it in front of them on the table.
Now all players must also, clockwise in turn, play a card and set it in front of them.
This must always happen: the first color played must be followed!
If a player can not follow the color, they may play any other color.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once play has gone once around the table, the highest card is determined first, the lowest card is determined after it.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The highest card is always the one with the highest number – independently of the color!
If several players have played the highest number, the one that was played last is regarded as the highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lowest card is always the one with the lowest number – independently of the color!
If several players have played the lowest number, the one that was played last is regarded as the lowest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player with the lowest card receives the highest card as profit.
They place it face up beside them on the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player who had the highest card receives all remaining cards as profit.
They place all captured cards face up on the table beside them, separated by color.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player who had the highest card now begins the next round in the same way described.
The game proceeds in this way until 15 rounds have been played and everyone has played all 15 of their cards.</p>

In the game everyone gets more and more cards as profit.

<h2 id="_final_scoring">Final Scoring</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player receives points for all cards, that they have won in the round.
Each color is tallied separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a player has only one or two cards in a certain color, they receive the face value of each card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player has more than two cards in a certain color, they only receive 1 point for each of these cards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, each player adds the points they have in the 5 colors.
That sum is his/her total score.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frank has the following cards in front of him at the end of the game:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In ♠: 4, 10, 11 = 3 points</p>

<p>In ♣: 5, 9 = 14 points</p>

<p>Frank’s total score is 52 points!</p>

<p>After the entire round, the results of each player are listed.
There should be as many rounds as there are players participating.
Whoever finally has the most points at the end of the game is the winner.</p>
