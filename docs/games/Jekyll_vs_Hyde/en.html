<p>Jekyll vs. Hyde is a trick-taking game for 2 players, based on the famous novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.
As Dr. Jekyll, you&#8217;ll need to resist Mr. Hyde&#8217;s fierce attacks to protect your mind and keep the secret of your dual nature.
As Mr. Hyde, your goal is to dominate Dr. Jekyll to overcome his identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One player is Dr. Jekyll; the other is Mr. Hyde.
The game plays in three rounds.
At the end of each round, Dr. Jekyll&#8217;s identity will progressively disappear under Mr. Hyde&#8217;s relentless attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mr. Hyde wins as soon as he reaches 5 points.
If He did not achieve this after three rounds, then Dr. Jekyll wins, escaping from Mr. Hyde&#8217;s dark influence.</p>

Dr. Jekyll always starts the 1st round.</p>

<p>The starting player plays any card from their hand, face up.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>If the starting player plays a ★ card, they must announce a color.
  Their opponent must play a card of this color <strong>(even if they have a ★ card!)</strong>.

<p>Trick-taking is a type of game in which each player plays a card on the table.
The player who played the best card takes them all.

<p>Colors are not ranked at the beginning of the game, but on each round, you will define their rank by playing cards.</p>

<p>The first color to appear (first Evil Card played) will automatically have the lowest rank.
Place the matching A card on the appropriated space below the ♦1 order card.
The second color to appear will be placed below the ♦2, at which point the last color will automatically become the best color for this round and be placed under the ♦3.
★ cards don&#8217;t have colors and cannot be ranked.</p>

As they can play any card, they play the ♥4.
