<p>The rules for recording the numbers on the score-sheets are <strong>exactly</strong> the same as in the original game.
<strong>Only</strong> numbers <strong>from 1 to 18</strong> can be recorded on the score-sheets.
The zero and minus numbers are <strong>not</strong> allowed to be recorded!
If you’re already familiar with the original game, you can continue reading at <a href="#setup">Game setup</a>.
Even the end of the game and scoring are identical to the original game.</p>

<h2 id="entering-numbers">Entering numbers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The order in which you enter the numbers in the suit rows is up to you.
For example, you can first enter a number in the ♥ row on the right, then in the middle of the ♣ row, and then on the left side in the ♣ row; then to the far right of the ♠ row, and then in the ♥ row on the left side, and so on and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When entering numbers you only have to follow these two rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Within a suit row</strong> (i.e. horizontally from left to right) the numbers must be in ascending order from left to right with the greater numbers to the right, and no number may appear more than once in the same row.
You may have gaps of any size between the entered numbers in a row, which you can fill in later (with the right numbers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Within a column</strong> (i.e. vertically from top to bottom) no number may appear more than once; the same goes for a 2-field column and a 3-field column.
The order of the numbers in a column doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Each suit row has one missing field.
Do not enter a number in this field.
It stays empty and serves no further purpose.
In each of the five columns consisting of 3 fields each there is one bonus field in the shape of a pentagon.
If all three fields in the column are filled with numbers, you get the number in the bonus field as bonus points.
