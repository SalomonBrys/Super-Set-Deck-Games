<p>The players play in turn clockwise.
When it is their turn, the player reveals numbered cards one by one: they must stop as soon as 2 numbers are different, otherwise they continue until 3 identical numbers are revealed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each number, they can decide to reveal a card:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist upperalpha">
<ol class="upperalpha">
<li>
<p><strong>In the middle of the table.</strong><br>
They turn any card they like face up in the middle of the table.<br>
OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>From a player&#8217;s hand, including themselves.</strong>
They reveal a player&#8217;s <strong>lowest</strong> or <strong>highest</strong> number: either from their own hand or by asking an opponent.
The card in question is placed face up on the table.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A player&#8217;s turn ends in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Either the player completes a trio and seals the deal by taking the 3 cards face up in front of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or a revealed number is different from the previous one, so all the revealed numbers are then put back in place: face down in the middle and/or returned to their owner(s).</p>
