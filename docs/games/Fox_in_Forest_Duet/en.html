<p>Use the <strong>side ⚑</strong> of the Path reference card and create the corresponding path between players with the 11 Path ♦ cards <strong>face down</strong> (their value do not matter), so that each player is facing one end of the path.

<li>
<p>Place <strong>12 Animal cards</strong> on the path location cards, with the number of Animal cards on each location matching the number of <strong>●</strong> inside the location space in the reference card (0–2).
Set the other Animal cards aside to form a supply.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Determine the Trick Winner</strong>: After both cards have been played, determine the winner of the trick.
To do this, you must take into account the ranks of the cards that were played, as well as the lead suit and the trump suit.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trump</strong>: If one or both of the cards in the trick are in the trump suit, the player who played the highest-ranked card in the trump suit wins the trick.</p>

<p><strong>No-Trump</strong>:  If neither card in the trick is in the trump suit, the player who played the highest-ranked card in the lead suit wins the trick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move the Monkey King</strong>: After the winner has been determined, the Monkey King moves.
Add together the movement values (defined in the Power &amp; Movement reference card) of the two cards in the trick, then move the Monkey King that many spaces along the path toward the player who won the trick (unless specified otherwise).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Beyond the path</strong>: If the Monkey King would move beyond the last unblocked path location on either end of the path, reset the Monkey King to the starting path space (indicated on the Path reference card with a crown) and place a Blocker ★ card so that it covers the last uncovered path space on that end.
This makes the path shorter for the rest of the game.
If you do not have a Blocker ★ card to place, the game ends in a defeat.
(See <a href="#end-of-game">End of the Game</a>.)
If a Blocker ★ card ever covers a path space in a location with one or more Animal cards, move those Animal cards one location space closer to the center.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animal cards</strong>: If the Monkey King ends up in a path space in a location space with one or more Animal cards (even if it did not move!), provided it was not just reset after moving beyond the path, the players collect one Animal card from that location space, returning it to the supply.
If you collect the final Animal card from the board, the game ends in a victory.

<p><strong>Deal the Next Round</strong>: Gather all 30 game cards and
