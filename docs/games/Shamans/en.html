<p>You are a shaman.
Since the dawn of time,you’ve been protecting the spirit worlds from the threat of the shadows.
Your mission has never been more perilous.
Before the moon is at its zenith, you must restore balance to the different worlds to keep the universe from falling into chaos.
But could the danger come from within your own ranks?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some shamans, corrupted by the shadows, are secretly working towards your failure&#8230;&#8203;
Perhaps you are one of them?</p>

<p>When the time comes, will you be able to read through the schemes of your rivals and find yourself on the right side of this age-old struggle?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shamans is a trick-taking game that lasts a variable number of rounds.
Each round represents a lunar cycle, during which Shamans and Shadows face off.
Each round, the players will be divided secretly and randomly between the two teams, Shamans and Shadows.
Indeed, this means that the teams change from round to round.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Shamans win the round if they either manage to eliminate all Shadows, or if the moon stack is not empty when players have played all their cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Shadows win the round, and 3 points each, if the moon stack is empty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players score points when they are on the winning team, and through several effects.
The player who has the most victory points at the end of the game will be declared the winner.</p>
