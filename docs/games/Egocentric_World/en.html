<p><strong>The goal of each player is to finish the game with the smaller Egocentrism score</strong>.
However, cards with high Egocentrism give advantages during the game.
One game can be composed of one or several <strong>rounds</strong>.</p>

<p>A card thrown into the discard pile is <strong>discarded</strong> when it came directly from the deck, or <strong>played</strong> when it came from the hand of a player.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>discarded</strong> card is put face up on the discard pile <strong>without triggering its special ability</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>played</strong> card is put face up on the discard pile and the player who played it <strong>can eventually trigger its special ability</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During your turn, <strong>you must complete one of the following actions</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Draw</strong> and look secretly at the first card from the deck.
Then you must EITHER <strong>discard</strong> it, OR keep it to replace one card from your hand.
The replaced card is then <strong>played</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take the first card from the discard pile</strong> to replace one card from your hand.
The replaced card is then <strong>played</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reveal a card from your hand</strong> of the same value as the first card on the discard pile and <strong>play</strong> it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reveal a pair of cards with the same value</strong> from your hand and <strong>play</strong> one of the two.
The other one stays in your hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Say “STOP”</strong> so the round will end just before your next turn starts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A round ends immediately if a player has no more cards in hand.</p>

<p>When a round ends, <strong>each player sums up the Egocentrism values in her hand</strong>.

<p>When a card of value 8 to 12 is <strong>jouée</strong>, the player playing it decides if its special ability is triggered or not.</p>

<p><strong>12</strong> : <strong>You can play another</strong> turn after this one.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>11</strong> : <strong>Designate two players</strong> (you can be one of them) and <strong>exchange two cards from their hands</strong>.
In the hand of each player, you can <strong>either take a card secretly</strong> - chosen freely if it is in your hand or randomly picked in another player’s hand - <strong>or announce a specific value</strong>.
If the player has a card with this value, she must exchange it.
If you announce a wrong value for one or both players, the exchange is cancelled, and you must draw and add to your hand a card as a penalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10</strong> : <strong>Designate a player and look secretly at all the cards in her hand.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9</strong> : This special ability is not activated when the card is played.

<p>Instead of confronting players, <strong>you compete two Citybots</strong>, one on your left and one on your right.
Those are considered players for game purposes.
All usual rules apply, with the few exceptions below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each game, <strong>set a difficulty level of 1, 2 or 3</strong>.
At the end of each round, before calculating scores, if the difficulty is 2, each Citybot removes its card with the lowest value.
If difficulty is 3, each Citybot removes its card with the highest value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the first round, the first player is the Citybot on your left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Citybot’s hand is composed of a <strong>pile of hidden cards</strong>, composed of 5 cards at the beginning of a round, and of <strong>visible cards</strong>, revealed in the course of the game.
Cards retrieved by a Citybot during the game are added to its visible cards.</p>

<h3 id="_citybots_turn">Citybot&#8217;s turn</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To resolve a Citybot’s turn, proceed to the following steps in the given order, until its turn ends.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If all its cards are visible and its <strong>Egocentrism</strong> total is lower than yours, the Citybot says “<strong>STOP</strong>” and its turn ends.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If not all its cards are visible and none has a value superior to <strong>7</strong>, it <strong>reveals</strong> the next card of its pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of its visible cards has the same value as the one on top of the discard pile, the Citybot <strong>plays</strong> this card and its turn ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at least two of its visible cards have the same value, the Citybot <strong>plays</strong> one of those cards (the highest value if there are several pairs visible) and its turn ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the highest value among its visible cards is superior to the one on top of the discard pile, the Citybot takes the latter card, <strong>plays</strong> its card with the highest value and its turn ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If its turn has not ended yet, the Citybot <strong>draws</strong> a card from the deck and <strong>reveals</strong> it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the highest value among its visible cards is superior to the drawn card, the Citybot takes the latter card, <strong>plays</strong> its card with the highest value and its turn ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In any other case, the drawn card is <strong>discarded</strong> and the Citybot’s turn ends.</p>
