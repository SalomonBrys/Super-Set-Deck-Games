<p>What’s all this nonsense about sea battles with thundering canons and grappling hooks!
In reality, it was all much more harmless!
Venerable pirates preferred to hold their battles at gaming tables in shabby taverns using playing cards.
The one who was not only able to wangle the most tricks from his opponent but also succeed in predicting them most accurately, won the contest.</p>

<h2 id="_objective_of_the_game">Objective of the game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pirates' contest lasts 10 hands.
In each hand the players have to bid the number of tricks they intend to win in that hand.
Then the objective is to fulfil that bid&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone who fails to fulfil their bid because they win too many or too few tricks loses glory and fame.
It can be very lucrative to make a no-tricks bid.
But it is also very risky&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the first hand each player has only one card at their disposal;
from hand to hand the number of cards increases by one.
In each hand the players endeavour to achieve as many points as possible.
The player who was able to collect the most points after 10 hands is the winner.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the cards are shuffled well.
Then cards are dealt to each player so that nobody can see them.
<strong>The number of cards changes from one hand to the next.</strong>
In the first hand each player receives only 1 card, in the second 2 cards etc. until in the tenth and last hand each player is dealt 10 cards.
Throughout the game, as many rounds are played as the players are holding cards in their hands.
[Example: it would not be possible to win 5 tricks if you are holding four cards as there will only be four rounds].
In each round every player has to play out one card openly, one after the other.
This is called a "trick".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After dealing, each player looks at their card(s) and thinks about how many tricks they will win with this/these cards.
To be able to see better, please remove all eye patches.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a sign that a player has decided on the number of tricks, they stretch a fist out towards the centre of the table.
When all the players are holding up their fists towards the middle of the table, they utter the pirates' battle cry <strong>"YO – HO – HO"</strong>.
As they do so all the players raise their fists and hammer them on the table with each word of the pirates' battle cry.
With the second "HO" the players all open their fists at the same time and stretch out as many fingers as the tricks they want to win in that round.</p>

<h3 id="_then_the_hewing_and_stabbing_begins">Then the hewing and stabbing begins</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player to the left of the dealer begins the round by playing the first card.
Clockwise the other players <strong>must follow the suit already played</strong>.
This means playing a card from the same suit.
Any player who can’t follow suit plays a different one (and loses the trick) or a ♠ (to win the trick if possible).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When all the players have played a card they can see who gets the "trick".
The player who has won the trick places it, facing down, in front of them, each trick separate from other tricks (enabling everyone to see clearly how many tricks the respective player already has), and then  plays the first card of the next round.</p>

<p>When all the cards have been played, the hand comes to an end and the scores are noted down.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is always the player who has played the highest card that wins the trick.
It is always the highest card of the suit being played.
If other cards from other suits are played than the first card played (because the player doesn&#8217;t have the suit) their value is irrelevant.
<strong>Exception</strong>: The ♠ is the highest suit, and it trumps all other suits (irrespective of its numerical value).
All other suits rank equal to one another.</p>

<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. Trick</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A ♦2 is played, followed by a ♦12.
The next two players don&#8217;t have any yellow and play a ♥13 and a ♠1.
The ♠1 wins the trick because ♠ is always the highest suit.
Without the ♠ card the ♦12 would have won the trick because it was the highest card in the suit (♦) being played.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a matter of principle <strong>a player must follow the suit</strong> first played.
However, even if he could follow the suit, he can <strong>always</strong> play one of the following <strong>special cards</strong>:</p>
