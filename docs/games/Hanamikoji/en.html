<p>Welcome to the most well-known geisha street in the old capital, Hanamikoji.
Geisha, the graceful women elegantly mastering in art, music, dance, and a variety of artistic performances after years of training, are greatly respected and adored.
Geisha may be translated to “artist” and they dance, sing and entertain everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Hanamikoji, two players compete to earn the favors of the seven geisha masters by collecting the performance items with which they excel.
With careful speculation and sometimes a few bold moves, you may earn the essential items by giving away the less critical ones.
Can you outsmart your opponent and win the most favors of the geisha?</p>

<p>One side is more than the other: The side with more Item Cards wins this Geisha.
