<p>1 first canvas card (the ★S).</p>

<p>The rules of ★ are simple: Have the best card!
But will you still be playing the same game when your turn ends?
If you’re not winning the current game at the end of your turn, you’re out, and the last person standing wins the round.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The deck consists of 49 cards, numbered 1-7, in each of seven rainbow colors.
A 7 is always higher than a 6, but when comparing two 6s, a 6★ is higher than a 6♠, and so on down the color order (★, ♠, ♥, ♣, ♦, ✿).
When comparing two cards, compare value first, then color.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin a game of Red7, deal out a seven-card hand to each player, and then deal one more card face-up in front of each player to start their Palette.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start the Canvas (discard pile) with the ★S card.
The top card of the Canvas pile determines what the rules are.
The player with the highest card on their Palette is currently the best at ★, so the player to that player’s left goes first.</p>

<h2 id="_your_turn">Your turn</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On your turn, you must take one of the following actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Play a card face-up from your hand to your Palette.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discard a card from your hand to the Canvas to change the
game to the rule of the discarded card’s color.
You must be winning the new game after you do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play a card from your hand to your Palette AND THEN discard a card to the Canvas.
You must be winning the game after you do this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do nothing, and lose.
You might want to do this intentionally when playing Advanced Red7 to limit the number of points an opponent will score.
If your hand is empty, you must do this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are not winning the game at the end of your turn, you lose and are out of the round.
Place your hand cards and Palette cards face-down.
If you start your turn and you’re the only player left, you win the round!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are currently winning a game if your Palette contains more cards that meet the current game’s rule than any other player.
To break a tie, look at each tied player’s highest card that follows the rule, checking its value, then its color if necessary.
If you have no cards (for ♣ or ⎈) that follow the rule, you are not winning.
Examples are to the right for each rule.
If you have no cards in your hand at the start of your turn, you lose since you are unable to do anything to win by the end of your turn.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you’ve played Red7 a few times, you might be ready for some advanced rules, and scoring between rounds!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advanced Red7 has two additional rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>When you discard a card to the Canvas, if the number on that card is higher than the total number of cards in your Palette, you may draw an additional card from the Draw Deck (unless the Draw Deck is empty).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The winner of a round scores points.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you win a round, take all the cards from your Palette that meet the current rule and place them in a face down pile in front of you.
For example, if you won ♦ by having the most differently colored cards on your Palette, take the highest card of each color from your Palette and place them in a face down pile in front of you.
The next hand is dealt without those cards, as they are now your score pile.
Cards are worth their face value in points.
If there aren’t enough cards to deal out a new hand to each player, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.</p>
