<p>The youngest player takes the starting player ⎈K card.
The starting player shuffles the 94 commodity cards and gives each player 1 card.
They place these cards face down to the right of their commodity counter-tops.
This is their starting cash.
The players may not look at the commodity side of their cash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The starting player places 1 purchase ⎈ card for each player face up in the center of the table.
Thus, with 3 players use purchase cards 1 - 3; with 4 players use purchase cards 1 - 4; and with 5 players use all 5 purchase cards.
Then, he deals each player 6 commodity cards face down.
Finally, he places the commodity deck face down in the center of the table.</p>

<p>The players may now look at (and organize) their cards; these are their starting hands.</p>

<p>The players place as many commodities as they want on their counter-tops.</p>

<p>Beginning with the starting player and following in clockwise order once around the table, the players may place commodity cards from their hands on their commodity counter-tops.
All the cards placed on counter-tops must be displayed openly; no card may be hidden by other cards.
A player may place any or all of the 6 cards in his hand each turn on his counter-top.</p>

A player who has no commodities on his counter-top must put at least 1 card there.
A player who has commodities on his counter-top may place more, but is not required to do so.

Otherwise, there is no limit to the number or type of cards on a counter-top.

<p>In contrast to putting commodities on counter-tops, the commodity cards are stored in the cellars one at a time.
The starting player begins.
He may store 1 card from his hand into his cellar, or he may pass.
Play continues in clockwise order with each player choosing either to store 1 card in their cellar or to pass.
Play continues as long as at least one player wants and is able to store cards in his cellar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first player to pass and not put a card into his cellar takes the number 1 purchase card and places it face up in his playing area.
The next player who passes takes the number 2 purchase card and so on until all purchase cards have been taken.
When this occurs, the next phase of the round begins.
After a player has taken a purchase card, he takes no further actions in this phase of this round (i.e. he may store no more cards in his cellar nor take another purchase card).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player may only store cards in his own cellar.
Players store the cards in the cellars face up and sorted by commodity type for all to see.

On a player’s turn he may purchase cards from any one (and only one) commodity counter-top, including his own.</p>

<p>When he purchases the cards from another player, he pays this player 1 banknote from his bank, regardless of how many cards were on the commodity counter-top.

In any case, however, he must take all cards from the selected counter-top; a partial purchase is not allowed.</p>

<p>The player must immediately put all purchased cards in his cellar.
If this results in the completion of a set of 4 cards, he immediately sells the set as described above.</p>

<p>If a player has no cards on his counter-top, he may purchase commodities from another counter-top or may elect to purchase nothing.
If he chooses to purchase nothing, the purchase phase ends immediately - players with purchase cards left may not make purchases this round.

<p>Using the commodity deck, the starting player deals enough commodity cards to each player to return their hand to 6 cards, beginning with himself and continuing clockwise around the table.
If needed, the cards from the discard pile are shuffled and used to supply cards for players' hands.

<p>Each player counts the cash in his bank - each banknote has the value 1.
Cards in players’ hands, on their counter-tops, and in their cellars have no value.
The richest player wins.
If two or more players tie, the player among them with the fewest cards remaining in their cellar and on their commodity counter-top together is the winner.
If there is still a tie, those tying share the victory!</p>
