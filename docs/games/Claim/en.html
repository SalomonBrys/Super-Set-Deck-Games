<p>The King is dead!
What happened?
Nobody really knows, but he was found face down in a wine barrel this morning.
It could have been either foul play or his own thirst that did him in.
Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it’s up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: will it be you or your opponent.
Do you have what it takes to win over the realm’s factions?</p>

<p>The game is played in two distinct phases.
In Phase One, each player gets a hand of cards that they will use to recruit followers.
In Phase Two, they will use the followers they gained in Phase One to compete and win over the five factions of the realms.
At the end of the game the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction’s vote.
The player who wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!</p>

If able, the other player must follow faction.
Which means, if this player has a card in their hand of the faction of the card just played then it must be played (exception: Doppelgänger (★)).
In other words, a player can only play a card of a different faction if no card in their hand matches the faction of the one played by the Leader.
