<p>In <strong>Chimera for three players</strong>, each hand players bid to be the Lead Player (Chimera).
The remaining two players team up (Hunters) to prevent the Lead Player from going out first and winning their bid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall players compete for points in several hands of play and the winner is the player who scores the most points once the designated point score is reached by one or more players.
Chimera is normally played to 400 points although longer or shorter games may be played.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chimera for five players</strong> is very similar to Chimera for three players,
It adds additional cards and changes to the bidding process.
Again, one player bids to be the Lead Player, but now will also choose one other player to be their partner (Pi Ya).
The other three players will be the hunters working to prevent the Lead Player from going out first and winning their bid.</p>
