<p>Each player is dealt cards.
They each select one of these cards to specify for themselves their “misery colour”.
The object of the game is to take as many tricks as possible, while avoiding cards of the “misery colour”.
Cards in the “misery colour” bring negative points, while the other colours bring positive points.
The player with most points wins.</p>

<h3 id="_choosing_your_misery_colour">Choosing your "Misery Colour"</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player looks at his hand and chooses his “misery colour” for this hand.
He then selects a card of this colour from his hand and places it face down in front of him.
Once everyone has placed a card face-down, all players reveal them at the same time.
They then remain face up until the end of the round.
Thus, everyone knows every one else&#8217;s misery colour.
It can happen that several players selected the same misery colour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each card in the misery colour that a player takes in tricks will score negative points according to the card&#8217;s face value.
The misery begins with the selection of the misery colour, because the card used to declare a player&#8217;s misery colour is counted against that player at the end of the round.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
When selecting a misery colour, a player should not choose a colour in which he has only 1-3 cards, nor from a colour in which he has very many cards.
Also, it&#8217;s better to choose a colour in which the cards he has have low numerical values, in order to avoid taking tricks with high cards in his misery colour.

<p>The cards played into the centre of the table are the “trick”.
The colour of the first card played is the “lead colour”.

<p>After 14 tricks (13 tricks with eight players) the round ends.
Each player now has at least one card in his misery colour (the card used to declare that colour), and possibly other cards taken in tricks.
Each card in his misery colour counts as negative points according to the numerical value on the card.
Each card not in his misery colour counts as one positive point, independent of the value on the card.
To determine a player&#8217;s score for the round, add the positive points and subtract the negative points.</p>

<p>Axel used a ♥4 to declare his misery colour.
In his tricks he&#8217;s taken a ♥2 and ♥5, as well as 14 cards in other colours.
For the 14 other cards Axel receives 14 points, and for the ♥ cards he receives \$4 + 2 + 5 = 11\$ negative points.

The player with the lowest score shuffles together the cards (including those set aside during the previous deal, if playing with 7 or 8 players), and deals the cards out (again setting aside the remaining cards).
If more than one player is on the lowest score then the player who scored lowest for the round is the dealer.
Each player selects a misery colour, which may or may not match his misery colour in the previous round.</p>

<p>The players select a personal “lucky colour” from the cards in their hand.
This means that each card in this colour that a player wins in tricks counts as positive points according to their numerical value.
Naturally, also the card chosen at the beginning to indicate this lucky colour counts positively.
However, now each card in other colours counts as one negative point, regardless of their numerical value.</p>
