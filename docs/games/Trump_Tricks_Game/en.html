<ul>
<li>
<p>48 game cards: 1-12 in ♠, ♥, ♣ &amp; ♦.</p>

<p>In this game, players try to make tricks to get cards.
In the first three game turns, the number of tricks is predetermined.
In the fourth and last game turn, each player must win as many tricks as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the basic game, there are two optional rules for a more challenging game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic game is based on two mechanics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tricks: The number of tricks a player may take is fixed in the first three game turns.
In this way each player receives the same number of tricks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cards: In the following turn, each player plays with the cards he got in the previous one as tricks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the player with the most points wins.</p>

<p>First the game and trump (A) cards are separated.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>With 4 players all game cards are used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With only 3 players the game cards with a value of 1, 6, and 12 are not used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Afterwards the game cards are shuffled.
Each player secretly receives 12 of them and takes them onto his hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the trump (A) cards are shuffled as well and put on the table.
Each one is placed slightly on top of the earlier placed one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The colors of the trump cards determine which color is trump color in each game turn.
The top card is trump in turn one.</p>

<p>Trump, Tricks, Game! consists of 4 game turns.
The player with the ♣ card of value 10 is the starting player.
The player with the most victory points begins in the other game turns.
A game turn consists of 12 rounds of card play.</p>

<p>Cards won are the hand cards of the players for the next game turn – the cards are not reshuffled and newly distributed.
In the fourth game turn each player tries to take as many tricks as possible.
Now it is important to catch as most cards as possibles (regardless of their values).</p>

<h3 id="_playing_a_card">Playing a Card</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game is played in clockwise order.
Each player always plays one card per round.
One player takes the trick and continues playing the next card.
Cards with higher numbers are more valuable than cards with lower numbers.
Tricks that have been won are placed, face-down, next to each player.</p>

<h2 id="_follow_suit_rule">Follow Suit Rule</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all game turns the players have to follow suit according to these rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The color of the card played first determines the “color of the trick”.
The other players have to play cards of the same color.
The player playing the card with the highest number takes the trick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player does not have a card in this color, he must play a card of a different one.
If he plays a card in the current trump color (take a look at the trump cards), he trumps any cards played earlier.
Trump color cards: The highest number played takes the trick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. Trick</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>♠ is trump color.
Michael plays a ♥ 5.
Karen follows suit and plays a ♥ 7.
Daniel trumps with a ♠ 8.
Peter does not have a ♥ card, too, however, he does not want to take the trick.
He plays a ♣ 1.
Daniel takes the card and will play the next card.</p>

<h3 id="_predetermined_number_of_tricks">Predetermined Number of Tricks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a player has already won the predetermined number of tricks, he cannot take more tricks in a game turn.
Cards played by such a player are not “counting” anymore.
However, the player still has to play one card and follow suit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player does <strong>not</strong> have to follow suit a card played by a player who already has won the predetermined number of tricks.
The first player who still needs tricks determines the “color of the trick” with his card.</p>

<p>He moves the trick openly to the other player.
This player may take it, or he may try to refuse it.
To refuse it, he must have a hand card that has a lower value than all the cards of the trick.
