<p>Players are split into 2 teams that each try to score points by taking tricks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each trick is influenced by the players' decisions at the start of the round.
For example, players choose the colors of the trump and the value of the trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In each round, players remove a Nyet! card of their choice, choosing what will NOT be allowed in the round.
For example, if a player removes the ♥ trump card, ♥ will not be the trump for the round.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The game is played over several rounds.
Each round is divided into 2 phases: the Nyet! phase and the trick phase.
During the Nyet! phase, the terms of the round are determined.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_playing_a_round">Playing a round</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin a round, the dealer shuffles and deals the cards to the players.
Then go to the Nyet! phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_nyet_phase">The Nyet! Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Players look at their cards and try to influence the terms of the upcoming round by removing Nyet! cards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dealer begins by removing one of the Nyet! cards of her choice from the table.
For example, if she only has a few ♠ cards, she might remove the ♠A Nyet! card from the table, declaring that ♠ is not a trump for this round.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each player continues clockwise, removing one Nyet! card from the table until each line has only one card left.
Once a line has only one card left, it may not be removed from the table.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_nyet_cards">The Nyet! cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line on the table explains the terms of the current round.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_line_1_first_player_character_cards">Line 1: First Player [Character cards]</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first player chooses his team.
The other players become the opposing team.
The first player chooses who receives the Bonus card, and plays first.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_line_2_discard_cards_cards">Line 2: Discard Cards [⎈ cards]</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this round, each player must discard the number of cards indicated.
These cards are not used during the round and do not count for points.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the ⎈K card is on the table, players must discard one card, excluding K cards (they must not discard a K cards).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the ⎈► card is on the table, each player must give one card to the neighbor on her left.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the ⎈0 card is on the table, discard no cards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_line_3_trump_a_cards">Line 3: Trump [A cards]</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trump color for the round is designated by the A card on the table.
Trump color can be ♠, ♥, ♣, or ♦.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_line_4_supertrump_s_cards">Line 4: Supertrump [S cards]</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The three K cards in the color of the S card on the table are the supertrumps.
Supertrump color can be ♠, ♥, ♣, or ♦, or there can be no supertrump at all.
If you chose a Supertrump in the Nyet! phase, it turns double agent!
Regardless of its original color, Supertrump becomes the same color as Trump in the trick phase.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_line_5_points_trickloot_cards">Line 5: Points (Trick/Loot) [★ cards]</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Card values do not matter for scoring.
Each trick taken and each K card captured by an opposing team (loot) earns the chosen number of points.
The ★-‽ card is negative: –2 points per trick/loot (see <a href="#loot">The Loot</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_trick_phase">The Trick Phase</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before the trick phase begins:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first player chooses teammates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players discard or pass cards as indicated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, the first player begins the first trick by playing a card of his choice face-up on the table in front of himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Play continues clockwise with each player placing a card face-up in turn, respecting these rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must match the color led, if you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cannot match the color led, you may play any card in your hand (including a Trump or Supertrump).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Trump is led, you must play a Trump or Supertrump if you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Supertrump is led, you must play a Trump or Supertrump if you can.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once each player has played a card, check to see who takes the trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 1. 5-player game</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Wolf card is on the table.
So, the Wolf player chooses a team of 3 players with the Butterfly and Monkey players.
He also chooses to give the Bonus card to either the Phoenix or Snake player.<br>
The ⎈0 is on the table, so no cards are discarded.<br>
The ♣A card shows that the trump color is ♣.<br>
The ♠S card indicates that ♠ K cards are the supertrumps.<br>
Finally, the ★2 card shows that in this round, each trick and each loot is worth 2 points.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_who_takes_the_trick">Who Takes the Trick?</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The card with the highest value in the color of the starting card takes the trick, as long as no trump or supertrump has been played.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If multiple cards of the same value and same color are played, the last card played takes the trick (this also applies for trumps and supertrumps).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one (or multiple) trumps are played without a supertrump, the trump with the highest value takes the trick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a supertrump was played, it takes the trick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player who took the trick picks up the cards and stacks them face-down in front of herself.
Stack each trick won separately.</p>

<p>She then begins the next trick by playing a card of her choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once all the tricks have been played and no players have cards in their hands, points are scored.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each team counts the number of tricks won and loot captured (see below).
This total is multiplied by the number indicated on the Points card.
The scorekeeper writes the results on the score-pad.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="loot">The Loot</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All K cards can become loot won by the opposing teams.
When a player wins a trick that contains a K card played by an opponent, he claims it as loot.
Each captured K card is placed to the side of the trick pile face-up.
It’s possible to win up to 3 loot cards during a trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="title">Example 2. Trick</div>
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first player (on a 3-player team) plays a ♦8.<br>
Her teammate plays a ♦K, and an opposing player plays a ♦3.<br>
The second player on the opposing team has no ♦ cards and chooses to play a ♣K (♣ is a trump).<br>
To finish, the last player on the 3-player team also has no ♦ cards and plays a ♣6.<br>
Player 5 wins the trick and takes all the cards.
He places the ♣K card in front of himself and stacks the other four cards face-down next to it.
The ♦K is not a loot card since one of his teammates played it.</p>
