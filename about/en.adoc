CAUTION: The name of a game may change from one language to another.


== Games

=== List

The "Games" list contains all games that are known to be playable with the Super-Set Deck.

TIP: This list is constantly evolving as new games are regularly being added.

You can filter this list:

* By player count.
* By game type.
* By favourites (which are individuals).

=== Rules

After clicking on a game, its rule are displayed.

IMPORTANT: All rules on this website are adapted to the specific cards of the Super-Set Deck!
           These are therefore not the original game rules, which you can often find on https://boardgamegeek.com[Board-Game-Geek].

Note that you can use the rules header to:

* Put (or remove) the game in your favourites list by clicking on the star icon to the left of the game name.
* List other games of the same type by clicking on the type chip.

=== In-game References

It may be hard to remember all particularities of a specific game.
To help you and your fellow players, we often provide reference images that help you during a game.

If we provide a reference for a game, then a tab bar will appear above the rules:

In this "Reference" tab, you'll find one or more images that should be helpful.

TIP: All these images use the game card format (63mm x 88mm).
     You can therefore print them as card if you want to access them without a screen.

Clicking on an image will display it fullscreen in the reference viewer.


==== Viewer

When in Reference Viewer mode, your screen (whether, phone, tablet or computer) is *prevented from going into sleep*.
This means that you can simply open a reference image in the viewer and put your phone on the table for all players to see.
The reference image will remain visible during the entire game.

Note that these images are on black background precisely to decrease battery usage when displayed for a prolonged time.

CAUTION: Be sure to close viewer mode once your game is over, to allow your phone to rest!

Once in viewer mode, if there are multiple references for this game you can:

* Swipe between images.
* Click on an image to center it.


=== Share

You can share the link to a game rule by clicking on the image:share-menu.png[Share Icon] share menu.

You can always display a QR-Code that links to the game page.

Additionally, on mobile only, you can share a link by message.


== Packer

The packer (in the left menu) is a feature that is useful when you want to pack the cards for a specific combination of games, and not travel with all the cards of the Super-Set Deck.

First, click on "Add Game" to add a specific game.
Note that you can configure the number of players, as well as the variants for the games you are packing (so that you will only pack the exact required cards).

The packer will then display the list of games you have chosen as well as all cards that are required to play all of these games:
