The King is dead!
What happened?
Nobody really knows, but he was found face down in a wine barrel this morning.
It could have been either foul play or his own thirst that did him in.
Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it’s up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: will it be you or your opponent.
Do you have what it takes to win over the realm’s factions?


== Set up

Shuffle all cards and place them in a face-down deck in the middle of the table.
Deal each player 13 cards.
Each player takes their cards into their hand without showing these to the other player.


== Game Overview

The game is played in two distinct phases.
In Phase One, each player gets a hand of cards that they will use to recruit followers.
In Phase Two, they will use the followers they gained in Phase One to compete and win over the five factions of the realms.
At the end of the game the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction’s vote.
The player who wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!


== Phase One: Recruit followers

This phase consists of thirteen tricks, one for each card in each player’s hand.
The Leader for each trick is the player who won the last trick (or in the case of the first trick the youngest player).

Each trick is played by following these three steps:


=== Reveal one card

Flip the top card from the deck in the middle of the table and place it between both players.
The players will be competing for this card.


=== Play cards

1. The Leader plays any single card from his hand.
+
NOTE: He can choose a card of any faction, this does not have to be a card of the faction the players are competing for.

2. Then the other player plays any single card from their hand.
+
IMPORTANT: If able, the other player must follow faction.
Which means, if this player has a card in their hand of the faction of the card just played then it must be played (exception: Doppelgänger (★)).
In other words, a player can only play a card of a different faction if no card in their hand matches the faction of the one played by the Leader.


=== Collect cards

1. The player that played the highest valued card of the faction played by the Leader wins the card in the middle.
+
NOTE: If the second player played a card of another faction, then the Leader automatically wins the trick, unless a faction power (Doppelgänger (★) or Knight (♥)) is in effect.

2. The winner places the cards they won face-down in their Follower deck.
The loser takes a card from the top of the deck in the middle and places it face-down in their Follower deck.
This player may look at the card, but is not allowed to show it to the other player.
+
NOTE: Cards in your Follower deck will be your hand for Phase Two.

3. If either player has played an Undead (♣) card, the winner of the trick takes them and places them face-up in their Score pile.
+
IMPORTANT: A won Undead (♣) card from the middle of the table still goes to the winner’s Followers pile.

4. Discard all (remaining) cards played.
+
IMPORTANT: Be sure to keep your Score pile face-up and your Follower deck face-down to keep them separated.

Continue until the deck is depleted and the players are out of cards in their hand. +
Now the game moves onto Phase Two.


== Phase Two: Gather supporters

Both players take the 13 Follower cards they gained during Phase One into their hand.
Now, players will play another 13 tricks.
However, instead of competing for particular cards in the middle, this time players compete for both cards
played each trick.

Each trick is played by following these two steps:


=== Play cards

1. The leader plays any single card from their hand.

2. Then the other player plays any single card from their hand.
+
IMPORTANT: The rules regarding following faction are still in effect!


=== Collect cards

1. Determine the winner like in Phase One.

2. The winner of the trick places both played cards face-up in their Score pile, unless a faction power (Dwarves (♦)) is in effect.

After all players have played all cards from their hand, all factions are scored.


== End of the game & Scoring

The players count how many cards of each faction they have in their Score pile.
Whoever has the most cards of a faction wins that faction’s vote.
If there is a tie, whoever has the highest single card of that faction wins the vote.
The player who wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!


== Faction’s special powers

Each faction has a special power that effects play.
They are as follows:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Faction | Symbol | Power

| Goblins | ♠
| No special power.

| Knights | ♥
a| When played after a Goblin (♠), it automatically beats a Goblin (♠) regardless of its value.

IMPORTANT: The player must still follow faction, if able.

| Undead | ♣
| Played Undead (♣) cards are not discarded in Phase One like the other faction’s cards, but instead are added to the trick winner’s Score Pile.

| Dwarves | ♦
| In Phase Two, the player losing a trick collects all Dwarves (♦) played during this trick and adds them to theirScore Pile.
The winner will still collect any non-Dwarves cards that has been played.

| Doppelgängers | ★
a| This faction is considered wild.
You may play a Doppelgänger (★) instead of the asked suit, *even if you’re able to follow suit*.
When played second, it is considered to be the same faction of the first card and is considered to be following faction.

NOTE: If the Leader plays a Doppelgänger (★), the other player still must follow faction by playing a Doppelgänger (★), if able.

IMPORTANT: A Doppelgänger (★) does not take any special powers from the faction it follows.
For instance, if played in Phase One after an Undead (♣) it does not get taken by the winner, nor would it get taken in Phase Two by the loser like a Dwarf (♦) would.
