Jekyll vs. Hyde is a trick-taking game for 2 players, based on the famous novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson.
As Dr. Jekyll, you'll need to resist Mr. Hyde's fierce attacks to protect your mind and keep the secret of your dual nature.
As Mr. Hyde, your goal is to dominate Dr. Jekyll to overcome his identity.

One player is Dr. Jekyll; the other is Mr. Hyde.
The game plays in three rounds.
At the end of each round, Dr. Jekyll's identity will progressively disappear under Mr. Hyde's relentless attacks.

Mr. Hyde wins as soon as he reaches 5 points.
If He did not achieve this after three rounds, then Dr. Jekyll wins, escaping from Mr. Hyde's dark influence.


== Setup

1. Choose who is going to be Dr. Jekyll and who is going to be Mr. Hyde.
2. Give each player the reference card corresponding to their role.
3. Place the three order card in order (1 to 2) between the two players, and the three A cards face down nearby.
4. Shuffle all Evil and ★ cards together.
5. Dr. Jekyll is the starting player.


== How to play

The game plays over 3 rounds. +
On each round, play the following phases in order:

1. Preparation
2. Trick-Taking
3. Progression of Evil


=== 1. Preparation

Each player receives 10 cards (the 5 remaining cards are not dealt; set them aside).

Each player then chooses 1 card from their hand to exchange with their opponent.
Place the card face down on the table and exchange them simultaneously (on round 2, you'll exchange 2 cards, and on round 3, 3 cards).

CAUTION: If you receive 2 or more ★ cards among your starting 10 cards, you must include at least 1 ★ card in the exchange.

.Round 2 example
====
It's the beginning of round 2.
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde must exchange 2 cards each. +
Dr. Jekyll has 3 ★ cards while Mr. Hyde only has 1; as a result, Dr. Jekyll must include at least 1 of his ★ cards in the exchange.
====


=== 2. Trick-Taking

At the beginning of each round, after the preparation phase, the number of points Mr. Hyde has determines who is the starting player.
If Mr. Hyde has 0, 1 or 2 points, Dr. Jekyll starts the round.
If the Mr. Hyde has 3 or more points, Mr. Hyde starts the round.
Dr. Jekyll always starts the 1st round.

*There are 10 tricks per round.*
*A trick plays as follows:*

- The starting player plays any card from their hand, face up.
- If the starting player plays a color card, their opponent must play a card of the same color, or they may play a ★ Card instead.
  If they don't have a card of the same color, they may play any other card.
- If the starting player plays a ★ card, they must announce a color.
  Their opponent must play a card of this color *(even if they have a ★ card!)*.
If they don't have any, they may play any other card.

*Then, compare both cards:*

- If both cards are of the same color, the highest number wins.
- If the cards have different colors, the highest color wins (see below), regardless of the number.
- If someone played a ★ card, resolve the corresponding effect, then the highest number wins.

The winner takes both cards from the trick and becomes the new starting player.

.What is trick-taking?
[TIP]
====
Trick-taking is a type of game in which each player plays a card on the table.
The player who played the best card takes them all.
The cards that have been played form a trick, and the winner takes it.
====

.Color Rank
****
Colors are not ranked at the beginning of the game, but on each round, you will define their rank by playing cards.

The first color to appear (first Evil Card played) will automatically have the lowest rank.
Place the matching A card on the appropriated space below the ♦1 order card.
The second color to appear will be placed below the ♦2, at which point the last color will automatically become the best color for this round and be placed under the ♦3.
★ cards don't have colors and cannot be ranked.

.Example
====
1. Dr. Jekyll played the ♠6.
   This is the first Evil Card played, so the ♠A card must be placed on the lowest rank.
2. Mr. Hyde does not have any Pride cards in their hand.
   As they can play any card, they play the ♥4.
   As the second suit of the round, the ♥A card must be placed on the middle space.
   Hyde wins the tricks even if Jekyll’s card has a higher number, because ♥ has a higher rank than ♠.
3. Automatically, the ♣A card is placed on the last space.
====
****

.★ Cards
****
When a player plays a ★ card, its effect depends on the card played by their opponent.

* ♠ (Blue) Card: The winner of the trick takes one trick (two cards) from their opponent.
* ♣ (Green) Card: Both players choose 2 cards from their hand (or 1 if it's the last one) and exchange them simultaneously.
* ♥ (Red) Card: Remove all colored A cards from the order cards.
  Reset the card ranks: the next color to appear will be the lowest one, and so on.

[NOTE]
====
* When a ★ card is played, the highest number always wins the trick.
* Double ★: If both players play a ★ card, then they neutralize each other; nothing happens, and the highest number still wins the trick.
====

CAUTION: ★ cards are higher than cards with the same value. +
         For example, the ★2 is higher than any other 2, but lower than any other 3.

.Example
====
As the first player, Jekyll played the ★4 and announced ♥ (red).
Hyde must play a ♥ card, so they play the ♥6.
Because of the ★ card effect, the color ranks is reset and Hyde wins the trick.
====
****


=== 3. Progression of Evil

Compare the number of tricks that each player has won in this round, subtract the lowest score from the highest one, and divide this result by 2
(for instance, if Dr. Jekyll won 6 tricks and Mr. Hyde won 4 tricks, then the final result is stem:[(6-4)/2 = 1]).
This result indicates by how many points Mr. Hyde gets this round.

NOTE: Evil is relentless!
      Even if Dr. Jekyll won more tricks that Mr. Hyde, Mr. Hyde still gets points.
      As Dr. Jekyll, your goal is to keep balance, without giving in to darkness!

If Mr. Hyde now has 5 or more points, then he instantly wins the game.
Otherwise, start a new round: remove the three colored A cards from the order cards and reshuffle all cards, including the 5 cards that you set aside at the  beginning of this round.


== Game End

At the end of the third round, Dr. Jekyll wins if Mr.Hyde did not achieve 10 points.


== Expert variant

In the base game, Dr. Jekyll is under constant pressure, and must plan every action with care.
For a more balanced and tactical game, play 2 games and switch the roles between each game.

Mr. Hyde no longer instantly wins with 5 points.
Instead, he must achieve the highest number of points in three rounds.

The best Mr. Hyde after two games wins the match.
In case of a tie, play another match!
