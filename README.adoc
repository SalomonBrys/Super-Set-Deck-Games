== Contribute

=== Contribute new game rules

Game rules are written using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

Each game has:

* Mandatory files:
** `en.adoc`: english rules.
** `game.yaml`: game properties (types & used cards).
* Optional files:
** Rules in other languages (such as `fr.adoc`).
** Reference cards named `R_*.png`.

The design files can be found in the `Design` directory.

All icons must be from https://game-icons.net.
